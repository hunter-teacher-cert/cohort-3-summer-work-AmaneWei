    Exercise 2  
    Letâ€™s say you are given a number, a, and you want to find its square root. One way to do that is to start with a rough guess about the answer, x0, and then improve the guess using this formula:
    
    x1 =(x0 + a/x0) / 2 
    For example, if we want to find the square root of 9, and we start with x0 = 6, then x1 = (6 + 9/6) / 2 = 3.75, which is closer. We can repeat the procedure, using x1 to calculate x2, and so on. In this case, x2 = 3.075 and x3 = 3.00091. So it converges quickly on the correct answer.
    
    Write a method called squareRoot that takes a double and returns an approximation of the square root of the parameter, using this technique. You should not use Math.sqrt.
    
    As your initial guess, you should use a/2. Your method should iterate until it gets two consecutive estimates that differ by less than 0.0001. You can use Math.abs to calculate the absolute value of the difference.

            roughGuess = nextGuess;
            nextGuess = (roughGuess + a / roughGuess) / 2;
        }

        roughGuess = nextGuess;
        return nextGuess = (roughGuess + a / roughGuess) / 2;
